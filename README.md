# 3d.js

This library implements 3d rendering with p5.js.

*Disclaimer:
This was heavily inspired by Daniel Shiffman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzsgS19RRc8, http://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/112-3d-rendering.html). I modified the code to work in javascript and I added quite a lot of features. Still, the foundation isn't mine.*
